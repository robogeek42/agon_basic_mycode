# agon_basic
Code repo for BBC Basic programs written for the Agon Light (2)

Just a place to save stuff for now.
I will put individual programs in their own repos if they provei useful.

## Sprite editor
sped.bas is a simple sprite editor.
Work in progress
Currently works in mode 8 with 64 colours and only works with a single frame of a 16x16 sprite/bitmap
