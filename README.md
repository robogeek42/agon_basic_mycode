# agon_basic
Code repo for BBC Basic programs written for the Agon Light (2)

Just a place to save stuff for now.
I will put individual programs in their own repos if they provei useful.

## Sprite editor
sped.bas is a simple sprite editor.
Work in progress
Currently works in mode 8 with 64 colours and only works with a single frame of a 16x16 sprite/bitmap

## mode3_cols
mode3_cols.bas 
Shows all the colours available in MODE8 (and any 64 colour mode)
Alongside my name for the colour - these are approximated from the standard HTML colour names.

## modetest.bas
Cycle through 32 modes (0-31) printing a hash in the 64 colours.
Primarily to see how the colour codes map in each of the modes.

## stars
stars.bas
Vertical scrolling stars in basic using double buffered mode
